aur, My packages in Archlinux AUR.
========================================

The [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is a community-driven repository for Arch users.

I maintain these [packages](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?SeB=m&L=2&K=GutenYe) in AUR. And I use [pacaur](https://github.com/Spyhawk/pacaur) helper.
